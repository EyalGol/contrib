# Flashcard
A KOreader plugin that implements spaced repetition (sm2) of your highlights and notes.

# Installation
Move the entire folder into /koreader/plugins

# Compatibility
Tested on Kobo Aura

# Todo
* Add a link to the bookmark location
* Not spawn all cards at once (aka a blocking wait)
* Maybe not search books via the readhistory (and history in general), might limit me someday, ideally I want it to just run over all of the books
* Maybe when a doc is opened add an option to just display card for this document
